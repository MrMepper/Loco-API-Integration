# Loco-API-Integration
Test API integration for Loco, a restaurant database

Created by Christopher Moore

Enables users to input State, City, Restaurant name, and Cuisine in order to search for restaurants
Displays the Name, phone number, and the address of the business

##Project Plans
1. Create a simple GUI instead of console application.
2. Prevent Restauraunts without phone/address from appearing.
